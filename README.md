 A database of the scientific literature relevant to Gender Affirming Hormone Therapy for transgender people.

Currently I am focusing on feminizing hormone therapy for transfeminine people, and hope to complement the great work from [Transfemscience](https://transfemscience.org). We would like to include research on masculinizing hormone therapy as well in the future, and would welcome and greatly appreciate collaborators if you would like to help us with the project. If you want any paper included please let me know!
