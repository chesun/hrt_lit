# Sex Hormones and Their Effects on the Immune System


### Immune effects of surgical menopause and estrogen replacement therapy in peri-menopausal women. Kumru et al. (2004)

The authors use a subject pool of 17 healthy peri-menopausal women who were to undergo total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy (TAH + BSO) for uterine myoma to study the short term effects of surgical menopause and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) on immunity profile in peri-menopausal women.

3 blood samples were collected from each patient: 1 day prior to surgery, 30 days after surgery and before ERT, and 30 days after transdermal ERT. Transdermal estradiol patches (17-`\beta` estradiol, 50 micrograms per day once a week).

After TAH + BSO, the percentage of CD8+ (T cytotoxic) cells increased, while the percentage of CD19+ (B-cells), serum IL-4 and IFN-`\gamma` concentrations and the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ cells were decreased. After ERT, this trend reversed and a decrease in the CD8+ cells, increase in the CD19+ cell percentages, and increase in serum IFN-`\gamma` concentration ratio were observed. Although the reduced ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ cells was partially reversed, and an increasing trend in the CD4+ cell to CD8+ ratio occurred by ERT, this was not significant.
