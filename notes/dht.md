# Notes on Dihydrotestosterone and Hair Growth

## Relationship between plasma testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations and male facial hair growth. Farthing et al., 1982

Compare 12 healthy men with 8 men with coeliac disease (increased T, decreased DHT). Linear facial hair growth was significantly reduced in coeliac patients compared with controls and correlated with plasma DHT but not with plasma T concentration. Hair density was significantly greater in coeliacs than controls and correlated only with plasma T concentration. Findings suggest T and DHT may have independent roles in facial hair growth: T for follicle priming and DHT for promotion of linear growth.
