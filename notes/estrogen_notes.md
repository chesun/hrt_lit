## **Medroxyprogesterone Acetate in Gender-Affirming Therapy for Transwomen: Results from a Retrospective Study**

### TL;DR:
Retrospective study using data from 290 follow-up visits (FUV) from trans women treated at Rhode Island Hospital, group with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) n=102 FUV, without MPA n=188 FUV. Assessed self-reported effects after MPA treatment, compared blood levels of E, testosterone, and other laboratory parameters between the two groups.
Results: no significant difference in mean E levels, lower mean testosterone level in MPA group. Of 39 trans women in MPA group, 26 reported improved breast development, 11 reported decreased facial hair, 5 reported mood swings.

### Data and Methods
- FUVs usually occur 3 months apart for the first year of treatment and annually thereafter
- Data are grouped by the regimen followed in the preceding 3+ months, and by dosage of E
- Additional of MPA is "generally a matter of patient preference, provided there are no clinical contraindications"
- Dataset consisted of 290 FUVs from a total of 92 patients. 39 patients are in the MPA group, 43 are in the no-MPA group
